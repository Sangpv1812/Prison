# Here you can edit some of the notifications in VR, allowing you to alter the
# language used.

# All messages support color codes using the & symbol!
# For example, &4 would make text red.
#
# You can also use the following tags for colors:
# %black% %darkblue% %darkgreen% %darkaqua% %darkred% %purple% %gold%
# %grey% %darkgrey% %blue% %green% %aqua% %red% %pink% %yellow% %white%
# %bold% %strikethrough% %underline% %italic% %reset% %magic%
#
# If you need to use quotes, do not forget to escape(backslash) them like this: \"

# Here you can define words to use in-lieu of the default word
# If a word is also used for a sub-command, changing the definition will also
# change the subcommand.
